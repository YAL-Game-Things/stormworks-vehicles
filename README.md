It's a dual-engine speedboat that's fairly light and cannot be flipped over thanks to its shape and center of mass.

Good for surfing tsunami waves and not very good for head-on collisions with terrain or other boats.

Some of the conveniently located islands on our map are these tiny cheap airfields that don't have a dock, so I thought "What if I make a version of our standard speedboat that can be spawned on an airfield and pushed into water?"

This is the first revision of that. You just grab a ~~leash~~ rope and pull your boat towards the nearest body of water, which works fine!

Alright, this one's a little more practical - all wheels are at the same level, there's a wheel clutch, and you can steer the wheels from the pilot's seat.

It is also flat enough to fit in those hangars for tiny planes.

You still get in the boat by jumping and grabbing onto the ladder.
